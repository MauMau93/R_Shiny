In 2002, Heather Tollerud, a Saint Olaf College student, undertook a study of the **archery scores** of students at the college who were enrolled in an archery course. Students taking the course record a score for each day they attend class from the first until the last day. Hopefully the instruction they receive helps them to improve their game.
